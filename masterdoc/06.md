### Exercise 4: Glimpse of Purview to govern the overall data and analytics estate. <a name="tee-up-the-purview"></a>

In Exercise 1, you loaded raw data into the Lakehouse. Then, in Exercise 2, you used a Delta Live Table pipeline to transform it into a data product for downstream consumption by analysts. 

In Exercise 3, you applied machine learning operations on this data product to build a customer sentiment model. This sentiment analysis allows Wide World Importers to determine which hashtags are trending so they can customize their campaigns to improve their sales while retaining their existing customers.

Meanwhile, Microsoft Purview provides a unified data governance service that helps manage and govern Wide World Importers’ data, which is stored in multi-cloud environments and in data sources such as Oracle, Teradata, ADLS Gen2, and Azure SQL Database.

In this exercise, you will explore Wide World Importers data estate that’s registered in Microsoft Purview.

1.	In the Azure portal web session (tab), in the search box (located across the top of the page), enter:**Microsoft Purview**.

2.	In the search results pane, select **Microsoft Purview accounts**.

Congratulations! You as Data Engineers, have helped Wide World Importers gain actionable insights from its disparate data sources, thereby contributing to future growth, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage.

In this lab we experienced the creation of a simple, integrated, open and governed Data Lakehouse foundation using the Microsoft Analytics Solution Pattern. 

In this lab we covered the following: 
1.	As a first step we looked at data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse. We started with streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX for a near real-time analytics scenario, followed by Synapse pipelines that ingested raw data from analytical/operational data sources to the Bronze layer. 

2.	The second step was to explore offline data and analytics pipeline using open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables. We stitched streaming and non-streaming data (landed earlier) together, to create a combined data product to build a simple Lakehouse.

3.	In the third step, we explored ML and BI scenarios on the Lakehouse. Here we reviewed MLOps pipeline using the Azure Databricks managed MLflow with Azure ML. Then, using Power BI with Synapse serverless SQL pool capabilities, we derived actionable insights. We explored SQL Analytics with Azure Databricks and Azure Synapse Serverless. Last, but not the least, we leveraged Purview for data governance. 

**Congratulations!!!**
**You have completed the Analytics in MIDP Lab.**

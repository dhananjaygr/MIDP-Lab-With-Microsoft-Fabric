## Getting Started with Lab

**Note:** It is recommended to have a good internet connectivity while performing the lab, and please ensure you are not connected to a VPN as this can slow-down the lab-user experience.

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine to perform the lab.

   **Note:** If you see the pop-up **experience.cloudlabs.ai would like to access the Clipboard to copy text**, please click on **Allow**.

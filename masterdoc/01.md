## Getting Started with Lab

**Note:** We recommend having a strong internet connectivity while performing the lab. Please ensure you are not connected to a VPN as this can slow down the lab-user experience.

1. When the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will be loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine to perform the lab.

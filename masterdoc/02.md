### Overview

![Analytics in MIDP](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Ignite-lab/blob/main/media/arch_1.png?raw=true)

The Demo/lab showcases Analytics in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform. The Analytics solution pattern is a cost-effective, performance-optimized, and cloud-native architecture which helps our customers unify their data estate to accelerate data value creation. The visual here depicts the Microsoft Analytics Solution pattern. 
The solution layers depicted here are as follows:

**1. Implementing a Lake First Data Foundation for Analytics**

Microsoft’s overall approach is based on an open and governed Data Lakehouse foundation for analytics. The open and governed Data Lakehouse foundation is a cost-effective and performance-optimized fabric for business intelligence, machine learning, and AI workloads at any scale. It is the foundation for migrating and modernizing existing analytics solutions, whether this be data appliances or traditional data warehouses. Finally, the Data Lakehouse is foundational for integrating data across a broad spectrum of emerging operational databases and systems including modern analytics applications

**2. Implementing an Open and Governed Data Lakehouse**

With raw data landed in the data lake, the next step is to transform and prepare the data for analytics applications. We believe the best solution for data transformation and preparation is to anchor to an open and governed data Lakehouse. This provides a unified approach to serve the full spectrum of BI, ML, and AI applications. In the past, data lakes were used to serve data science applications, data warehouses, and data marts for BI applications. They relied on complex ETL pipelines to move data between, and across, the fabrics. Now, with the data Lakehouse foundation, we have a unified foundation to serve the most demanding BI, ML, and AI applications while also optimizing for performance and cost.

**3. Machine Learning and Data Analysis in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform**

**Machine Learning:** Data scientists can bring their preferred compute frameworks, languages, runtimes, and tools to the data Lakehouse to access data prepared for ML applications. In addition, they can further refine and enhance the data through feature engineering and additional statistical techniques. In most environments, experiments are performed iteratively to produce machine learning models which provide the desired business outcomes.

**Data Analysis:** Ad-hoc and interactive data analysis using notebooks is a top line workload and experience for data analysts. While data analysts can also use the Spark modalities generally used by data scientists, it is more common for data analysts to prefer SQL modalities. Up until recently, there was no clean solution to enable ad-hoc and interactive SQL data analysis directly on data in a data lake. With recent advances, we now have solutions to address this need with the following customer options in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform: 

- Synapse Serverless SQL notebooks 
- Azure Databricks SQL Analytics notebooks

**4. Business Intelligence in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform**

The Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform offers best-in-class integrated solutions to responsibly democratize business intelligence with self-serve tools and experiences for data analysts and data citizens.

**5. Data Governance in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform**

Microsoft Purview is the single-pane data governance solution in the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform. We need to work with our customers to guide them in how to effectively scan and manage their analytics estates in Microsoft Purview. Our customers will also see the Databricks Unity Catalog when using Azure Databricks. We seamlessly integrate Purview with the Databricks catalog and metastore to enable a single pane governance solution and experience that spans the MIDP analytics estate across Azure Data Lake, Synapse, Azure Databricks, Power BI, and Azure Machine Learning. Microsoft Purview serves as a single-pane solution to address end to end data governance.

### Introduction

![Analytics in MIDP - Interactive Lab Experience](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Ignite-lab/blob/main/media/img_labexp.png?raw=true)

In this interactive demo/lab, you will experience an integrated, open, and governed Data Lakehouse foundation based on the Microsoft Analytics Solution pattern.  
We will cover the following:

**Exercise 1:** As a first step, we will look at Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse.
- We start with streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX for a near real time analytics scenario. 
- This will be followed by Synapse pipelines that ingest raw data from analytical/ operational data sources into the Bronze layer.
	   
**Exercise 2:** The second step is to explore offline data and analytics pipeline using open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables for data transformation.
- We will stitch streaming and non-streaming data (landed earlier), to create a combined data product to build a simple Lakehouse.  
	
**Exercise 3:** In the third step, we explore ML and BI scenarios on the Lakehouse. Here we will review MLOps pipeline using the Azure Databricks managed MLFlow with Azure ML.
- Using Power BI with Synapse serverless capabilities we derive actionable insights 
- We will explore SQL Analytics with Azure Synapse Serverless and Azure Databricks.

**Exercise 4:** Finally in the fourth step, we will leverage Purview for data governance.

### Setting The Scene

You will work through an example of a real world implementation for the fictitious Wide World Importers Enterprise.

Wide World Importers is a brick-and-mortar retailer that has hundreds of stores worldwide and a fast-growing online store. It sells a wide variety of consumer merchandise, including sunglasses, sports shoes, watches, wallets, books, and various beach products.

The lab scenario starts on May 30th, 2021. The company's new CEO, April, recently noticed negative trends in their KPIs, including:

- High customer churn
- Declining sales revenue
- High bounce rate on their website
- Poor customer experience

In a purely reactive mode, as soon as the company saw these adverse KPI trends, they launched some traditional campaigns. On September 5 (Labor Day), the results of those campaigns were received. The company noticed that the campaigns failed to be effective.

So, April talked with Rupesh, the chief data officer (CDO), about these adverse KPI trends and recommended a data-driven approach.

In this exercise you will act as a Data Engineer. Rupesh would like you to improve the above KPIs using the following requirements:

- Leverage data from the past, present, and future (Volume).
- Enable quick turnaround time (Velocity).
- Support open standards data format (Variety).

Let’s get started with the lab.
